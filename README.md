#YeastBot on Rails

This is a port of 
[YeastBot](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmRc5_x3ehAfdFhBQ3pmczhqdHUtbmFONUYyZzVEY0E&authkey=CP-m-dUJ&hl=en&authkey=CP-m-dUJ#gid=3) 
to make it more pretty/functional.

#To Do

 * Remove search term from 'other popular styles'
 * Improve search function - possibly implement jQuery combobox?  
 * Test more than successful GET
 * Download YEASTBOT DB daily/weekly to use locally so queries are minimized
